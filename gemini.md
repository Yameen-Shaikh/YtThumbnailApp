# Application State Summary

## Application Description
This is a Django-based YouTube viewer application that allows users to add YouTube videos and channels to a collection. It fetches video information and displays it in a paginated list.

## Recent Changes
1.  **Fixed 'playlistVideoRenderer' Error**: The issue with adding channels, specifically the `'playlistVideoRenderer'` error, has been resolved. The application now directly parses YouTube playlist pages to extract video IDs, bypassing `pytube`'s problematic playlist parsing for non-standard items like YouTube Shorts.
2.  **Added Borders to URL Input Fields**: The URL input text boxes for both adding videos and channels now have visual borders and improved styling using Tailwind CSS. This enhances the user interface and clarity.

## How to Run the Application
Assuming you have Python and `pip` installed, and are in the project's root directory (`/Users/yammu/Desktop/R&A_App/`):

1.  **Activate the virtual environment (if not already active)**:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (if you haven't already)**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # You might need to create this file first if it doesn't exist
    ```
    *(Note: Based on the `venv` contents, `Django`, `requests`, and `pytube` are likely already installed. If `requirements.txt` is missing, you can generate it using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.)*

3.  **Apply database migrations**:
    ```bash
    python youtube_viewer/manage.py migrate
    ```

4.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    python youtube_viewer/manage.py runserver
    ```

5.  **Access the application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` (or the address displayed in your terminal).
